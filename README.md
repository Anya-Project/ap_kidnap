# Cinematic Kick & Ban System for QBCore

**ap_kidnap** is a FiveM resource designed for the QBCore Framework. This script transforms the standard, boring `/kick` and `/ban` admin commands into an immersive and cinematic kidnapping scene, complete with multiple NPCs, visual effects, and full integration with the QBCore banning system.

This isn't just a utility; it's an experience.

## üé¨ Key Features

This script has been built from the ground up with a focus on stability, immersion, and advanced features not found in similar scripts:

*   **Dual Functionality:** Supports both `/kidnapkick` for warnings and `/kidnapban` for serious offenses, all within one immersive package.
*   **Full QBCore Ban Integration:** Bans are correctly logged to the database and are **visible in `qb-adminmenu`**, maintaining server data consistency.
*   **Dynamic Multi-NPC Scene:** The scene involves **two SWAT NPCs** with different roles: one handles dragging the player, while the other stands guard with a weapon, creating a realistic ambush scenario.
*   **Complete Cinematic Package:**
    *   **Locked Gameplay Camera:** The player's camera remains in the normal third-person view but is locked, preventing them from looking away and breaking the immersion.
    *   **Widescreen Effect (Letterbox):** Cinematic black bars appear during the scene for a movie-like feel.
    *   **Camera Shake:** A impactful jolt effect when the player is "captured," enhancing the physical sensation.
*   **"The Setup" Scenario:** Instead of entities spawning out of thin air, the screen fades, and the player fades back in to find themselves already ambushed, creating a dramatic surprise effect.
*   **Intelligent Entity Spawning:** Utilizes `GetClosestVehicleNode` and `PlaceObjectOnGroundProperly` to spawn entities in logical, stable positions on the roadside, reducing visual bugs.
*   **Multi-Layered Protection (Robustness):**
    *   **Anti-Spam:** Prevents admins from accidentally running the command twice on the same target.
    *   **Condition Checks:** The scene will safely abort if the target is already dead, bleeding, or inside a vehicle.
    *   **Automatic Cleanup:** Entities are properly networked and will be automatically cleaned up if the target disconnects mid-scene, preventing "orphan" entities.
